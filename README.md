# Stencil
A web application framework built on top of a distributed storage platform.

<p align="justify">
The prevalence of cloud-hosted services puts Internet freedom at risk due to the concentration of control over user data in the hands of a few major service providers. These cloud service providers can unilaterally inhibit Internet freedom by limiting usersâ€™ access to and publishing of data. Data can be blocked, filtered, modified, and even deleted from the cloud without user permission and often without users even knowing about it. Today web service programmers build their systems on cloud platforms because the APIs and tools exist to enable such development, but nothing comparable exists for decentralized app development. If such tools were to exist, web service programmers would have an off the-shelf option for building apps that are difficult to surveil. Our team is designing a distributed storage platform, Stencil, which aims to fill this gap. Stencil is an anti-surveillance decentralized, web-oriented platform for building shared-data apps. Stencil will provide an API for building multi-user apps in a manner that is cloud-like but actually decentralized and is a replacement for existing shared-data storage.

Project: By re-building a number of existing applications, such as Piazza, Web Forum, and Slack, we demonstrate how Stencil works and can evaluate its performance. This project involves building these and other applications. The student will work with our lab to re implement these popular applications on top of the Stencil API, test, and evaluate their performance to inform the design and implementation of the Stencil. If time permits, the student will work on pieces of the Stencil implementation itself.
